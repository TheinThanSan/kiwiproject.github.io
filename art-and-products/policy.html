						<p class="text-white-50">
							3.1 We basically process your personal data in order to provide and operate the Marketplace and render our services to you in accordance with our user agreement (cf. under https://www.kiwi.com/agreement), in particular, (a) to facilitate and coordinate sales and purchases via the Marketplace; (b) to provide you, to the extent possible and reasonable, with a smoothly and accurately functioning Marketplace by monitoring and maintaining its performance (in particular, detecting and resolving issues and errors); (c) to enable and process communication with our support service in case of queries via live chat, e-mail, web forum, social media or phone; and (d) to enable you to communicate and/or exchange ideas with other users via the Marketplace through message boards, chatrooms or other interactive online forums and/or to provide reviews regarding the products offered via the Marketplace.
						</p>

Each user is solely responsible for its posted comments. If you choose to use any such interactive area, please be aware that this environment and all personal data posted there is publicly accessible. We cannot control how other visitors of the Marketplace will use this information. In particular, we are unable to prevent you from receiving unsolicited messages from third parties.</br></br>

							3.2 Further we may process your personal data for the purpose of preventing fraud on the Marketplace.</br></br>

							This processing is necessary for the purpose of our legitimate interests. Our legitimate interests in this context are the protection of the integrity of the Marketplace, our services, our system as well as our users.</br></br>

							3.3 Further, we process your personal data for our endeavors (a) to provide you with an optimal and meaningful user experience on the Marketplace and within our services; and (b) to improve and optimize the Marketplace and our services, the layout and content of the Marketplace.</br></br>

						<h1 class="font-size-30 py-3 font-ms">4. HOW WE KEEP PERSONAL DATA SECURE</h1>
						<p class="text-white-50 pb-5">
							While we take all necessary and reasonable steps to keep your information secure, no security system is impenetrable and, due to the inherent nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise, will be absolutely safe from unauthorized access by others. Your payments are handled over an encrypted connection or via a secure third-party data processor. Access to personal data on our databases is subject to reasonable technical safeguards and is restricted to authorized staff on a strict need-to-know basis. Further, we require our external service providers with access to personal data to sign data processing agreements (Art. 28 GDPR) that require them to take the necessary and reasonable steps to protect the personal data provided to them.
